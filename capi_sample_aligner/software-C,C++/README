# folder structure:
	
	./app_versions 	=> contains previous versions of the program
	./src	 		=> contains sources and the Makefile
	./build			=> the Makefile builds here the program.
	./include 		=> custom C headers

# how to run the app:
	
	1. run modelsim simulation first. (use wave_app_X.do from "../../waves")
	2. run(build if necessary) the pslse emulator in "../pslse-master/pslse"
	3. run './main_test -q query -l library -t <<timeout_in_seconds>>', located in the folder "./build"

# run the Makefile in "./src", if it's necessary to build the 'main_test' app
