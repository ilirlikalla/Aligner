# important files:
	
	afu_control.v 	=> it is a template for the ScoreBank's AFU controler 
	SM_Feeder.v		=> first iteration of the Feeder module, does not work properly (target registers get overwritten)

	
	All the other files have been cleaned from the extra tracing logic that was used in the "mem_cpy" example
